    "content": "Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons, the two designers behind Prada, are well aware that fashion is about more than clothes. However, backstage after their menswear show in Milan on Sunday, the duo said the volatile present moment was a difficult one to translate to a collection. “You talk about the world now,” said Prada “or you talk about fashion … The two things together, in this moment, are difficult.” The collection was, therefore, “uncomfortable”. Rather than meaning the clothes were not pleasant to wear – this is luxury fashion, after all – there were disparate elements put together in the same outfit: the top of a red sou’wester over a trenchcoat, for example, or a yellow scoop-neck jumper with cuffs of a shirt falling out the sleeve. (There were also some useful unexpected styling tips, such as wallets stuffed in a back pocket, or brightly coloured shoe laces). Asked about the role of the designer now, Simons responded: “We ask ourselves that question every day. [We might not answer it but] the fact that we [ask the] question is important. You cannot be in an ivory tower and not look around.” Simons said the connections between fashion and politics had changed: “In the past, people did react to world situations with the way they dressed, if you go to the 60s or 70s and further back. Now, it’s not directly a reaction [but] we feel like we should not sit still, we want to try.” He pointed to the deconstructed tailoring, as with those shirt cuffs, as one way to reject the image of the political elite. “We don’t want the American corporate kind of masculine power,” said Simons. “No, make it youthful.” “Now is a moment of big changes,” said Prada. “Who knows the future? [But] what do you want to keep? What can you transform? How can you learn from this?” Based on this collection, having more questions than answers has rarely looked so good. Dolce &amp; Gabbana’s show on Saturday has also become a talking point during the menswear shows, thanks to what looks like an entirely white cast of models, despite the show being titled The Portrait of Man. Fashion commentators including Blakely Neiman Thornton, Louis Pisano, Brown Fashion Girl, boringnotcom and Lyas have posted on Instagram about the casting. Lyas posted a video calling it “50 shades of white”, pointing out the “audacity” of the title. With more than 41,000 likes, comments underneath the video showed support for his arguments. This is not the first time Dolce &amp; Gabbana has been at the centre of controversy around race. In 2012, it produced earrings featuring what looked like Blackamoor figures. In 2016, the brand named a shoe “slave sandal”. And in 2018, there were adverts that featured culturally insensitive images of a Chinese model attempting to eat pasta and cannoli with chopsticks. In response, Stefano Gabbana allegedly sent a direct message on Instagram to a user who had criticised the advert, in which he referred to China as “ignorant dirty smelling mafia”. The brand responded that their Instagram account, and that of Gabbana, had been hacked. At Prada’s last menswear show in June the brand was called out for cultural appropriation when models wore footwear with the distinctive toe-ring design of India’s traditional Kolhapuri sandal, which dates back to the 12th century. After the Maharashtra chamber of commerce complained, Prada’s head of corporate responsibility, Lorenzo Bertelli, responded: “We acknowledge the sandals … are inspired by traditional Indian handcrafted footwear, with a centuries-old heritage.” If Bertelli, the son of Prada, suggested in June the company would be willing to potentially work with Indian artisans on the shoes, no designs as yet are to be found on the brand’s website.",

    "published_at": "2026-01-18T17:58:25Z",
    "content": "It is true that science is self-correcting. Over the long term this means that we can generally trust its results – but up close, correction can be a messy process. The Guardian reported last week that 20 recent studies measuring the amount of micro- and nanoplastics in the human body have been criticised in the scientific literature for methodological issues, calling their results into question. In one sense this is the usual process playing out as it should. However, the scale of the potential error – one scientist estimates that half the high-impact papers in the field are affected – suggests a systemic problem that should have been prevented. The risk is that in a febrile political atmosphere in which trust in science is being actively eroded on issues from climate change to vaccinations, even minor scientific conflicts can be used to sow further doubt. Given that there is immense public and media interest in plastic pollution, it is unfortunate that scientists working in this area did not show more caution. The questions raised are mainly about the measurement of quantities of micro- or nanoplastic in the human body. In particular, one method, pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, may have either been used or interpreted incorrectly. There is still robust evidence via other methods – such as electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy – that these small-scale plastics are in our organs. What is in doubt now is how much. Many, though not all, of the studies in question were conducted mainly by medical researchers, and published in medical journals. It is possible that there was a lack of rigour or technical expertise in chemistry. Some scientists have noted that this is a young field, and best practices are still being established. But extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and public interest in this field means that results will be seen as extraordinary in the wider world, whether or not researchers think they are. Until clear and widely agreed standards are established for these plastic measurements, great care – and perhaps wider consultation and peer review – should be taken before results are published, and reported in the media. Hopefully the spotlight trained on the field last week will prompt reflection and future caution. There is, of course, a long-established playbook for magnifying and misrepresenting scientific conflicts – with attempts to discredit the science of global heating a case in point. This is not fair, but it is the world we live in. Scientists are confident that there will be some consensus on the scale of plastics in our bodies soon – probably within a few years. But even when the science becomes clearer, this row will probably be referenced by bad actors to discredit future results. After all, the plastic industry is downstream of the fossil fuel industry and employs many of the same lobbying techniques. Concerns about plastic pollution have thus far transcended traditional political boundaries. Hopefully that will remain true. More worrying than the situation in Europe is the Trump-captured scientific system in the US. Last year an executive order entitled Restoring Gold Standard Science warned that strict criteria will be used to disqualify studies from being used as evidence for government policy. Many are concerned that even normal debates and differences of view between researchers could be used to reject wide swathes of well-agreed fact. In effect, science’s treasured self-correcting method could be turned against it.",

    "content": "Online disinformation campaigns, including Iranian bot farms promoting Scottish nationalism and biased algorithms depicting London as “an overwhelmingly dangerous” city, are seeking to undermine British democracy, a senior Labour MP has warned. Emily Thornberry, the Labour chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said online disinformation about the UK was being promoted by Donald Trump and other US and UK politicians, and Britain was “constantly suffering from disinformation campaigns from both state and non-state actors”. Thornberry said it was time to challenge tech companies over “the threats that social media pose to our society”. The committee has written to X, Meta and TikTok calling on them to give evidence on the threat posed by foreign disinformation targeting the UK. “We must start a proper dialogue with social media companies about the ways their platforms are being used to spread lies from abroad and undermine our democracy. And we need to do it urgently,” she said. Thornberry accused Reform UK, whose MPs have repeatedly described UK cities as crime-ridden and dangerous, of repeating false claims that were then amplified, while biased algorithms promoted “strife and far-right messages”. Reform politicians were “raking in tens of thousands of pounds from X” and rewarding sites that sowed anger and spread disinformation, she said. Last week the Reform mayoral candidate Laila Cunningham said London was “no longer safe”, while the party leader, Nigel Farage, said London was “in the grip of a crime wave”, despite a fall in multiple crime types including murder. Trump has claimed the UK capital has “no-go zones” and that its mayor, Sadiq Khan, is moving the city “towards sharia law”. Analysis of Reddit by Dr Mark J Hill, of King’s College London, found that the number of posts claiming London is “dangerous” and “lawless” rose from 874 in 2008 to 258,444 in 2024. He found evidence of new accounts that appeared to use AI-generated profile pictures and post solely about crime in London. Thornberry said: “We are seeing lies that start in bot farms and are then disseminated on social media sites become statements of fact from the likes of the US president, and increasingly from politicians here at home. That’s so dangerous for our democracy.” Keir Starmer, launched a formal investigation into foreign election interference in the UK in December after Nathan Gill, Reform’s former leader in Wales, was found guilty of accepting bribes to promote Russian interests in the European parliament. Last Tuesday, the foreign affairs select committee heard evidence that bot accounts based in Iran were fomenting support for Scottish independence in an attempt to destabilise the UK. After internet shutdowns inside Iran following escalating anti-government protests, 1,300 fake profiles seeking to influence discourse on Scottish independence, Brexit and institutional collapse went dark, according to Cyabra, a Tel Aviv-based disinformation detection company. The UK Defence Journal reported that a second internet blackout had resulted in the bots being silenced again. In his evidence to the committee, Vijay Rangarajan, the chief executive of the Electoral Commission, argued that the UK did not currently have sufficient safeguards against an algorithmic bias. If a social media company decided to amplify or suppress political discourse “they probably could”, he said, adding: “I do not think anything in our current legislative toolkit would enable us … to take any action against that, and that really is a concern.”",

    "content": "Summer storms on Australia’s east coast have claimed one life and threatened dozens more as flood waters rise. Residents and holidaymakers were evacuated from Narrabeen Lagoon in Sydney’s northern beaches overnight on Saturday, but were told they could return on Sunday. It came as a landslide damaged three homes and injured at least one woman 20km north, at Great Mackerel beach. New South Wales State Emergency Service crews responded to 1,403 calls for help in the 24 hours to 5am Sunday, as cars were submerged and homes flooded. At least 20 people were rescued from floods, most of who had been driving through flood waters, according to SES assistant commissioner Sonya Oysten. “That Sydney northern area again, we are urging everyone to keep safe, keep inside if you can, a great day for indoor activities,” Oysten told the ABC. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “There’s a lot of people holidaying in areas that they’re not really aware of … If you don’t know the roads, please try to avoid any travel.” At least 1000 volunteers had been responding to over 2,100 calls for help supporting clean-up efforts across NSW, mostly in Sydney and surrounds, the SES said. Sydney’s Observatory Hill recorded 56mm of rain from 5am to 7am on Sunday. Shane’s Park on Sydney’s north-western edge recorded 53mm of rain in just one hour, taking its 24-hour total above 100mm and breaking January records. Conditions eased across much of coastal NSW on Sunday afternoon, but heavy rainfall continued to buffet the mid-north coast. Comboyne, 60km south of Port Macquarie, recorded 73mm of rain between 3:02pm and 4:02pm. Warnings for hazardous surf remained in place on the east coast at beaches stretching from Newcastle to Batemans Bay, as well as the Eden coast. Strong winds were also battering coastal NSW from Coffs Harbour to the Hunter region, the BoM warned. Winds eased around Sydney and the Illawarra by Sunday afternoon. A woman died after a tree branch fell on her car while she was driving through Macquarie Pass, south of Wollongong, on Saturday afternoon, NSW police said. A man in the front passenger seat suffered minor injuries while the two back seat passengers were unharmed. Queensland has also faced a bout of wild weather as a band of thunderstorms rolled across the south-east, dumping up to 60mm and leaving about 11,000 properties with power. More thunderstorms and heavy rain hit the state’s south-east on Sunday afternoon, threatening flash flooding and hailstones. More than 2,000 properties were still without power in Laidley and Brightview in Queensland’s Lockyer Valley region after wild weather took roofs off homes and brought down trees. Eleven flood warnings were in force across Queensland as rivers rose in the wake of ex-Tropical Cyclone Koji. Central Queensland would continue to face major flooding for much of the next week while low-lying areas of Rockhampton were at risk of inundation, the BoM’s senior meteorologist, Dean Narramore, told the ABC. In Victoria, sunny skies met the first day of the Australian Open’s main draw. Melbourne was set to reach a high of 29C on Sunday, while the temperature in Adelaide rose to 36C. Storms and heavy rain were forecast for Darwin, with a high of 31C. Perth was set to reach 27C, Brisbane 30C and Hobart 21C.",

    "content": "European leaders have hit back at Donald Trump’s threats to impose tariffs on countries opposing his Greenland takeover, saying the move would “undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral”. The US president threatened a 25% tariff on a slew of European countries – including Denmark, Germany, France and the UK – until the US is allowed to purchase Greenland, in an extraordinary escalation of the president’s bid to claim the autonomous Danish territory. In response the French president, Emmanuel Macron, warned that “no amount of intimidation” will persuade European nations to change their course on Greenland, while Britain’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, said the threat was “completely wrong”. Trump threatens 25% tariff on European allies Donald Trump said he would impose a 10% tariff on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland beginning 1 February, “on any and all goods sent to the United States of America”. He said the tariff will increase to 25% on 1 June. “This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” Trump said in a lengthy post on Truth Social. Read the full story Macron: ‘No intimidation or threats will influence us’ Emmanuel Macron immediately called Donald Trump’s tariff threats “unacceptable”. He said they had “no place” in a context in which Europe was trying to defend Greenland, and in which Denmark was an EU member state, Nato member and signatory to the UN charter embodying international law. “No intimidation or threats will influence us, whether in Ukraine, Greenland or anywhere else in the world, when we are faced with such situations.” Read the full story Starmer says Trump’s tariff threats are ‘completely wrong’ Keir Starmer said Donald Trump’s decision to impose 10% tariffs on the UK and seven other European countries over Greenland was “completely wrong”. “Our position on Greenland is very clear – it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes,” the UK prime minister said on Saturday evening.

In many ways, the scene looked like other DC rallies over trans and queer rights over the past decade. But the protests appeared to have a visible shift in the size, tone and aggression from the crowd opposing trans rights, advocates said.

    "content": "The smell of burning flesh and pulverised concrete is seared into the psyche of Anneke Weemaes-Sutcliffe. On 22 March 2016, the Australian expat was due to check in for a flight when Islamic State suicide bombers detonated two nailbombs inside Brussels airport. Miraculously unharmed, she sprinted to the exit after the second blast exploded metres away from her – but then, risking her life, decided to turn back. Screams, wailing alarms and a thick blanket of dust choked the air. The ceiling had caved in. “It turned from buzzing with life to a war zone. It’s horrific, absolutely horrific,” Weemaes-Sutcliffe says. Without hesitation, she crawled over debris and bodies to tend to the wounded, tying tourniquets to stop mutilated survivors bleeding out, comforting them and calling their loved ones to let them know what had happened. In the aftermath of mass violence, the instinctive actions of ordinary people such as Weemaes-Sutcliffe offer a counterpoint to horror – flashes of courage that become symbols of hope. Off-duty nurse Lynne Beavis ran towards gunfire rather than to safety during the 1996 Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania to help the wounded; holidaymakers Richard Joyes and Timothy Britten rushed into a burning nightclub in the wake of the Bali Bombings, rail worker Samir Zitouni blocked a knife-wielding attacker on a high-speed train in Cambridgeshire, saving lives and risking his own. Then there are the bystanders immortalised in the international media by the everyday objects they wielded to halt violence. French citizen Damien Guerot became “Bollard Man” after he confronted the Bondi Junction attacker, who killed six people, in 2024. The Australian government granted him permanent residency for his bravery. In Melbourne in 2018 it was “Trolley Man” Michael Rodgers who fended off a knife attacker with a shopping trolley. Rodgers, homeless at the time, received more than $155,000 in donations before deciding to turn himself in to police on historical theft and burglary charges. Sign up: AU Breaking News email And then, perhaps most starkly, there is the case of Syrian-born Ahmed al-Ahmed, who rose to international fame after he was filmed wresting a rifle from a shooter during Australia’s deadliest terror attack that last month killed 15 people at Sydney’s Bondi beach. In the days that followed, a revolving door of politicians stood by his hospital bedside and praised his heroism. This month he opened a cricket match to a roaring ovation, and made a whirlwind visit to the United States that included attending a Jewish gala dinner, media interviews and meeting members of Congress. Meanwhile, a GoFundMe has so far raised more than $2.65m to support his recovery. But what happens to these people crowned heroes once the headlines fade? A year after the Brussels attack Weemaes-Sutcliffe was awarded an Australian Commendation for her bravery, but that recognition has done little to quell the trauma she has endured. Amid the chaos of the airport attack, Weemaes-Sutcliffe tried to heave a beam that had fallen from the ceiling and pinned a man to the ground. It was too heavy to lift. “I had to turn around and leave him there to die,” she says. “You question every single detail – it’s like, could I have done more?” ‘They’ve never spoken to anyone’ “Society is well practised at recognising acts of bravery but poorly equipped in identifying or addressing the negative consequences,” says Dr Thomas Voigt, who interviewed 24 Australian bravery award recipients for his PhD studying the consequences of heroism. Nearly 90% of award recipients Voigt interviewed were either diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder or displayed symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome (a similar but less severe condition). One-third suffered financial hardship because they became unemployed or worked reduced hours because of their condition. For Voigt, the subject isn’t just academic. In 1998, he was working at a community health centre when a drunk patient drew a loaded double barrel sawn-off shotgun on staff. Without thinking, he rushed towards the gunman. “I remember it in very slow motion. I took eight steps to get to him, the gun being waved in all directions” he says. Voigt then crash-tackled the gunman to the ground and disarmed him. No one was hurt. The ordeal earned him an Australian bravery medal but cost him too. He developed PTSD symptoms that still linger today, 28 years later. “Generally speaking, there’s lots of media attention and lots of hype, you get your award but then there’s nothing,” Voigt says. Emergency services staff involved in traumatic events receive structured support, but no formal dedicated services exist for civilians; 71% of those interviewed by Voigt received no formal intervention or support after their act of bravery. “Evidence tells us that the best way to address trauma is by intervening within the first three to six months,” he says. “I’m seeing people who responded to an incident 10 years ago and they’ve never spoken to anyone.” ‘The spotlight moves on’ It was Wednesday, 30 July 1997, when thousands of tonnes of liquefied earth descended upon two Thredbo ski lodges, in the New South Wales alpine region, burying 19 people. In the aftermath Dr Fiona Reynolds, then an ABC reporter, rubbed shoulders with victims’ family members as they watched rescue crews dig through the rubble, desperately hoping that their loved ones would be found alive. “And there I am, standing in their space, looking for the next story angle,” Reynolds says. That experience led Reynolds to research how people survive traumatic events in the media spotlight, publishing a PhD in 2019. After mass casualty events, media coverage can help make sense of tragedy but also exacerbate trauma for survivors and grieving families, Reynolds says. On day three of the search, sole survivor Stuart Diver was found and quickly elevated to hero status. “It was an extraordinarily uncomfortable label for him, given the loss of 18 lives, including his wife, Sally. That was not the time to shine.” Reynolds says. Diver became an “accidental celebrity”, an ordinary person who is unwittingly thrust into the spotlight at the cost of their privacy and agency, often compounding feelings of helplessness associated with trauma. In general, media and public attention can destabilise one’s very identity. “When you are held up as a hero type, you can naturally feel very special,” Reynolds says. “Then the spotlight moves on. For some people that’s welcome, but others feel suddenly unimportant and even discarded.” “One day everybody wants to know you, the next everybody wants to know somebody else.” The impulse to crown a hero in moments of terror is as ancient as it is universal, says the University of Sydney academic and former journalist Prof Catharine Lumby. In the wake of unimaginable violence, society often divides events into familiar categories of victims, villains and heroes. “It’s a kind of oversimplification of a chaotic event but is also a way of processing uncertainty,” Lumby says. These narratives serve to restore “moral order” when institutions and social norms appear to fail, but can also compress complexity, flattening people into one-dimensional heroes and forever attaching them to the traumatic event, she says. Once the public story has been told, the question for survivors is how – or whether – to reclaim meaning on their own terms. Post-traumatic growth Of the civilian bravery awardees interviewed by Voigt, one in five expressed doubt as to whether, if put in the situation again, they would act the same way. It’s a thought that has crossed Weemaes-Sutcliffe’s mind. “After the bombings, I probably wished I hadn’t gone back in [to the airport], because I fucked up my life,” she says, describing years marked by intrusive memories, panic and enduring guilt for those she could not save. “But now life is good – I’ll be sitting on the porch looking at the sunset and I think, shit, I probably would have never been in a position to appreciate this as much as what I do if I hadn’t gone through that.” Coexisting alongside PTSD is post-traumatic growth – the psychological changes or personal development that can occur after trauma. For some that materialises in pursuing a passion or sudden urge to tick items off the bucket list, Voigt says. For Weemaes-Sutcliffe it’s a greater appreciation for the small joys of life: that glass of wine after work, morning coffee or delicious piece of cake. “Because you just never know what will happen tomorrow,” she says. “One day it might be you.”",
